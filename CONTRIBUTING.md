## Before you begin

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about) (CLA).
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.

If you or your current employer have already signed the Google CLA (even if it

### Review our Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contribution Process

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Self Assigning Issues

If you're looking for an issue to work on, check out our list of issues that are labeled ["help wanted"](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/workspace/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

To assign an issue to yourself, simply add a comment with the text `/assign`. The comment must contain only that text and nothing else. This command will assign the issue to you, provided it is not already assigned.

Please note that you can have a maximum of 3 issues assigned to you at any given time.

### Pull Request Guidelines

To help us review and merge your PRs quickly, please follow these guidelines. PRs that do not meet these standards may be closed.

#### 1. Link to an Existing Issue

All PRs should be linked to an existing issue in our tracker. This ensures that every change has been discussed and is aligned with the project's goals before any code is written.

- **For bug fixes:** The PR should be linked to the bug report issue.
- **For features:** The PR should be linked to the feature request or proposal issue that has been approved by a maintainer.

If an issue for your change doesn't exist, please **open one first** and wait for feedback before you start coding.

#### 2. Keep It Small and Focused

We favor small, atomic PRs that address a single issue or add a single, self-contained feature.

- **Do:** Create a PR that fixes one specific bug or adds one specific feature.
- **Don't:** Bundle multiple unrelated changes (e.g., a bug fix, a new feature, and a refactor) into a single PR.

Large changes should be broken down into a series of smaller, logical PRs that can be reviewed and merged independently.

#### 3. Use Draft PRs for Work in Progress

If you'd like to get early feedback on your work, please use GitHub's **Draft Pull Request** feature. This signals to the maintainers that the PR is not yet ready for a formal review but is open for discussion and initial feedback.

#### 4. Ensure All Checks Pass

Before submitting your PR, ensure that all automated checks are passing by running `npm run test && npm run lint`. This command runs all tests, linting, and other style checks.

#### 5. Write Clear Commit Messages and a Good PR Description

Your PR should have a clear, descriptive title and a detailed description of the changes. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for your commit messages.

- **Good PR Title:** `feat(cli): Add --json flag to 'config get' command`
- **Bad PR Title:** `Made some changes`

In the PR description, explain the "why" behind your changes and link to the relevant issue (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
